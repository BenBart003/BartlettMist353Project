- map can be zoomed into
- able to click and hold to move around
- not able to click to get weather data of specific area
- very advanced website with lots of things going on

Accuweather has a lot of "stuff" happening. I assume a lot is going on in the backend. Inspecting is quite overwhelming. But keeping thing basic, the map is, well, a map. You cannot click on the map to get information, you have to insert an address of some kind, which is not a planned part of my idea, but could be.

- Map that returns Latitude and Longitude
- Uses Apple Maps
- Also has option to type in address
- Does appear to have some bootstrap elements

While this website isn't a direct competitor, it could become a good resource. Clicking on their map can return coordinates. This is something I will have to design myself, but it could help me with some ideas and concepts.

- Map with clickable weather stations
- Clicking on station shows data about surrounding area
- Able to type in address
- Layers
- Legend

This website shows weather station and the data from them. Each weather station dot is different colors depending on temperature it has some different aspects depending on weather. There is a useful legend the user can pull up to decipher what the different things mean. It appears to be using multiple APIs from weather.com.

"Simple Weather App" is a Web application that takes a city a user input and displays the current weather. While I will be using historic data, this still involves finding a city based on a user input. I would want to add a map as well. There is a live demo in the README.

Click for Coordinates is a web application that gets geo-coordinates by clicking on a map. According to the README is will display the coordinates as either a JSON or CSV. This could be something I could pull ideas from to help get my coordinates to then find historical weather data.
